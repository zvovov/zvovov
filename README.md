### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I am Chirag

I am currently working on making machines be more creative. Do check out my writings on [zvovov.github.io](https://zvovov.github.io)  

Always up for interesting conversations about: 
  - :movie_camera: Cinema (I like [David Fincher](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000399/), [Anurag Kashyap](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0440604/) and [Denis Villeneuve](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0898288/) and [more](https://zvovov.github.io/blog/tags#movies))
  - :garlic: Cooking (I source recipes from (Joshua Weismann)[https://www.youtube.com/c/JoshuaWeissman] and knowledge from (Samin Nosrat)[https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/])
  - :cartwheeling: Fitness (Practicing routines focused on [strength](https://www.youtube.com/user/FitnessFAQs) and [flexibility](https://www.youtube.com/c/Strengthside) through [movement](https://www.youtube.com/user/portaldo))
  - ðŸŒ± Using machine learning in real-life (primarily for fun :dancer:, :money_with_wings: optional)
